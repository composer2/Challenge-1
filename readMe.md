## Tested only on Chrome and best at 1280px sceren size. The images are not exactly the same cause I didn't use any css only classes from Foundation Framework and as far as I read on the documentation it doesn't suport something like img-circle like Bootstrap. With a litle bit of extra css would look like the task image (anyway its not in the requarements)
